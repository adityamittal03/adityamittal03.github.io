## Overview

An exploratory fairness analysis in R that computes and visualizes classical metrics (e.g., statistical parity, equalized odds) across groups on a tabular dataset.

## Goals

- Implement core fairness metrics and diagnostics in R.
- Summarize disparities and provide actionable plots/tables.

## Deliverables

- Report: `/projects/ml-fairness/reports/ml_fairness_report.pdf`
- Code: `/projects/ml-fairness/code/ml_fairness_code.R`
- Data (if provided): `/projects/ml-fairness/data/`

## Outcomes

- Consolidated set of fairness indicators and plots to guide further mitigation steps.
